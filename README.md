# Autonomous Multi-Agent AI: Reinforcement Learning for Self-Organizing Swarm Intelligence  

ðŸš€ **Project Overview:**  
This repository contains my NeurIPS 2025 research submission on **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** for decentralized swarm coordination. The goal is to **train self-organizing AI agents** using PPO & MADQN in PyBullet to **collaborate, adapt, and optimize swarm intelligence.**  

âœ… **Features:**  
- AI-powered swarm coordination using **Reinforcement Learning (PPO, MADQN)**  
- Decentralized **multi-agent self-organization in PyBullet**  
- Benchmarks vs. **traditional rule-based swarm AI**  
- Applications: **Self-driving car fleets, drone swarms, autonomous logistics**  

ðŸ”¥ **In Progress â€“ Open for Collaboration & Discussion!**
