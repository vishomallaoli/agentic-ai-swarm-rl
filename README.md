# agentic-ai-swarm-rl
This repository contains my NeurIPS 2025 research submission on Agentic AI &amp; Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for decentralized swarm coordination. The goal is to **train self-organizing AI agents** using PPO &amp; MADQN in PyBullet to **collaborate, adapt, and optimize swarm intelligence.**
